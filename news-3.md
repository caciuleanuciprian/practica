The 33-year-old is reportedly close to signing a contract extension that will keep him at the Camp Nou until the summer of 2023. Lionel Messi has been strongly linked with Manchester City and Paris Saint-Germain after he made public his desire to leave Barcelona last summer, but has now seemingly agreed to stay at the club.<br>

Lionel Messi is close to agreeing a two-year contract extension with Barcelona according to reports in Spain.<br>
Spanish newspaper AS report the 33-year-old is on the verge of putting pen to paper on a two-year deal that will end intense speculation over his future at the Camp Nou.
Messi has been strongly linked with Manchester City and Paris Saint-Germain since he publicly expressed his desire to leave Barcelona last summer amid concerns over the direction of the club.<br>

Since then, Josep Bartomeu has been ousted as Barca president, with Joan Laporta returning to the role for a second stint earlier this year.<br>
The report claims only “structural details” are left to be finalised before Messi signs a new contract that will keep him at Barcelona until the summer of 2023, when he could decide to play somewhere else.<br>
A return to Newell’s Old Boys, where Messi was spotted by Barcelona as a youngster, could reportedly be on the cards as a “swansong” for the 33-year-old.<br>

“Things are going well, but it is not a done deal yet,” Laporta said about negotiations with Messi on Tuesday.<br>
“The thing with Leo is that it is not a matter of money from his side. From our side, we know the limits of the possibilities we have and he is showing a lot of understanding. He wants to stay and we will try our best to make that happen.”<br>
