            <h2>Copa America 2021: Lionel Messi’s last chance for glory with Argentina?</h2>
            <hr id="newshr">
        </div>
        <p>For Lionel Messi, it must feel like he’s climbed out of the frying pan and immediately been engulfed by the flames of the hottest fire.
            The club season has ended and he has escaped the media circus that surrounds him in Barcelona. For a while at least, the speculation about his future can be put to one side.
            Yet he has landed in Argentina to join up with his national team and prepare for a Copa America that is to be played in the midst of dual political and public health crises in Brazil, which has only been confirmed as host at the very last minute. What’s more, it is a tournament that could come to define Messi’s legacy with the Albiceleste.
            Whether this Copa America should be going ahead at all is doubtful. It was originally scheduled for June and July 2020 as a transitional tournament. To be played just a year after the 2019 Copa America, in which Argentina fell valiantly to hosts Brazil in the semi-finals, it was shoehorned into the calendar to mark the shift of the tournament to a four-yearly cycle that would see it coincide with the European Championships.
            It was also bizarrely split over two countries, Colombia and Argentina. For Messi, it was a chance to play a major tournament, or at least most of one, on home soil. But logistically it made no sense. There are 5,300km, two time zones and the equator between Buenos Aires and Barranquilla. While the former would be in the middle of the Southern Hemisphere winter the latter would be basking in the heat of a Caribbean summer.
            Then the pandemic came and, like the Euros, the Copa America was postponed until 2021, supposedly to allow time for the situation to improve. Only it did not.
            As the rescheduled tournament approached, punitive government tax reforms in Colombia worsened the economic situation of people already terribly affected by the pandemic and sparked protests which were violently quashed by security forces, leading to over 50 deaths so far. And in Argentina, the number of Covid cases and deaths tragically shot up in April and May.
            Colombia was the first to back out as host, and for a while it seemed as if the entire tournament could move to Argentina. Eventually, the Argentinian government decided the pandemic was too bad. A national lockdown was announced and the moment deemed inappropriate for putting on an international football tournament.
            In stepped Brazil: less than two weeks before the first game, the tournament was moved to the country that hosted it in 2019. Relocating the competition from Argentina, which is enduring a terrible time with Covid, to a country where more than 460,000 people have died from the disease has sparked huge waves of criticism. One Brazilian senator referred to it as the “championship of death”.
            But Conmebol were desperate for the Copa to go ahead, and Brazil’s far-right, pandemic-denying president Jair Bolsonaro intervened to make sure it would. On Monday, May 31, Conmebol’s official account tweeted: “Conmebol thanks the president [Bolsonaro] and his team, as well as the Brazilian Football Confederation for opening the doors of that country to what is today the safest sporting event in the world. South America will shine in Brazil with all its stars!”
            Quite how Conmebol have worked out it will be the “safest sporting event in the world” is anyone’s guess – and all the criticism directed at them and the Brazilian president is entirely justified. The morally correct decision would have been to cancel. But for the players, the fact remains that the tournament is going ahead. They will have to do their utmost to get to Brazil fully prepared.
            For Messi, there is extra significance to this tournament, even though it is not being played in his homeland as he might have hoped. He will turn 34 during the Copa America, so it could be his last realistic chance of achieving the one thing that has eluded him throughout his career – a major international trophy.
            At next year’s World Cup, the Barcelona captain will be 35 and Argentina will not be among the favourites to lift the trophy. By the time the next Copa America rolls around in 2024, he will be 37 and, as painful as the thought is, may not be playing professionally any more.

            <h2>What they said: The 13 players to play alongside Messi and Ronaldo</h2>
            <hr id="newshr">
        </div>
        <p>The longstanding debate of Cristiano Ronaldo versus Lionel Messi has divided football fans for over a decade – but what about the players who know them best?

            The pair are regarded as two of the greatest footballers of all time and they have won 11 of the past 12 Ballon d’Or awards between them.
            
            Here’s a selection of quotes from the few players fortunate enough to have played alongside Messi and Ronaldo, thanks to help from SPORTbible.<br>
            
            Gerard Pique <br>
            
            – “Cristiano is a perfect machine, a hard worker who always wants to improve,” Pique told Voetbal Magazine in 2014. “He is very demanding of himself, something that he showed at United.
            <br>
            “Many times conclusions are drawn based on specific actions without actually getting to know him. He has changed in recent years, I know him from United and he took to me well. He helped me a lot in Manchester.”
            – “I always said that Messi has some talent that no one has,” Pique told BT Sport in 2016. “I mean, he has the ball and his speed controlling the ball. The ball doesn’t go two metres far from his foot, it’s always there. It’s impossible to catch him, this talent I didn’t see from anyone.

“But for me it’s like Messi is not human but [Ronaldo] is the best of the humans.”
<br>
Andre Gomes 
<br>
– “Ronaldo is a very important player, who is always present and ready to play,” Gomes said in 2016. “He is very serious about the responsibility of leading our country, we have great spirit, and he’s a great example for all of us.”

– “Everyone knows that Messi is very, very good,” Gomes told L’Esportiu de Catalunya in 2016. “He does things in games that you cannot explain; he just knows different things and can do it.

“In training, it is a show, because every day he can invent something new. You think you’re used to it, but there is always one day you go to the dressing room surprised by something he has done.”

Gonzalo Higuain 

– “We had already played together with Real,” Higuain told Fox News on Ronaldo in 2019. “Many years have passed, and I have found another player, a more mature person, with a family.

“I enjoyed playing alongside him before and I am glad that we are back together.”

– “I’m a forward and I have the chance to play with Messi. It’s a privilege to play alongside him,” Higuain said in 2012.

“Every time he gets the ball you need to be on your toes because you know that at any moment he can give you a great ball or pull your marker away from you. He does things that a striker can anticipate but a defender can’t.”

Henrik Larsson

– “It is very hard to select the best footballer in the world,” Larsson told UEFA in 2007.

“There is so much difference between a defender and a striker, but Ronaldo is definitely one of the best. In his position, he is the best and he is probably the best player around at the moment.”

– Six years later, Larsson told Xarxa: “Cristiano is unlucky to be playing at the same time as Messi. Ronaldo is a very good player, but Messi is even better.

“He is from out of this world. He’s so good that it’s almost incredible. When you see him with the ball at his feet it’s hard to believe that anybody else could do the same. He’s a fantastic player to see.”
Nelson Semedo 

– “Real Madrid have noticed his absence a lot,” Semedo told Portuguese channel SIC in 2019.

“I cannot say that it was bad for us (Barcelona) that Cristiano left. With him it would have been a more difficult league for us, more competitive. He (Ronaldo) is a player that requires a lot of attention and care.”

– “Speaking to Barcelona’s official website in 2017, Semedo said: “Messi is spectacular. It’s a privilege to play with him, he always surprises, he’s from another planet.”

Ezequiel Garay 

– “When people ask me who is the best player ever, I say Leo,” Garay said in 2011. “From the first time I saw him with Argentina Under-15s to this day he continues to amaze me. He has no limit.”

Deco 

–  Speaking about Ronaldo, Deco told ESPN Brazil in 2015: “The guy is sick, I haven’t seen anyone in training sessions like that. I think it’s really difficult to be like that.

“They are completely different. Though Messi takes care of himself like a normal athlete, Ronaldo is unbelievable. It borders on sickness because he always wants to be the best at his job. He competes in everything.”

– “There is no doubt that Messi is the best player in the world, he does incredible things and keeps on breaking records,” Deco told Esports COPE in 2012.

“I think Cristiano is nearly as good as Messi. They are both phenomenal footballers, but in different ways. They are far and away the best footballers in the world.”
