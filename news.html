            <h2>Copa America 2021: Lionel Messi’s last chance for glory with Argentina?</h2>
            <hr id="newshr">
        </div>
        <p>
            For Lionel Messi, it must feel like he’s climbed out of the frying pan and immediately been engulfed by the
            flames of the hottest fire.<br>
            The club season has ended and he has escaped the media circus that surrounds him in Barcelona. For a while
            at least, the speculation about his future can be put to one side.<br>
            Yet he has landed in Argentina to join up with his national team and prepare for a Copa America that is to
            be played in the midst of dual political and public health crises in Brazil, which has only been confirmed
            as host at the very last minute. What’s more, it is a tournament that could come to define Messi’s legacy
            with the Albiceleste.<br>
            Whether this Copa America should be going ahead at all is doubtful. It was originally scheduled for June and
            July 2020 as a transitional tournament. To be played just a year after the 2019 Copa America, in which
            Argentina fell valiantly to hosts Brazil in the semi-finals, it was shoehorned into the calendar to mark the
            shift of the tournament to a four-yearly cycle that would see it coincide with the European
            Championships.<br>
            It was also bizarrely split over two countries, Colombia and Argentina. For Messi, it was a chance to play a
            major tournament, or at least most of one, on home soil. But logistically it made no sense. There are
            5,300km, two time zones and the equator between Buenos Aires and Barranquilla. While the former would be in
            the middle of the Southern Hemisphere winter the latter would be basking in the heat of a Caribbean
            summer.<br>
            Then the pandemic came and, like the Euros, the Copa America was postponed until 2021, supposedly to allow
            time for the situation to improve. Only it did not.<br>
            As the rescheduled tournament approached, punitive government tax reforms in Colombia worsened the economic
            situation of people already terribly affected by the pandemic and sparked protests which were violently
            quashed by security forces, leading to over 50 deaths so far. And in Argentina, the number of Covid cases
            and deaths tragically shot up in April and May.<br>
            Colombia was the first to back out as host, and for a while it seemed as if the entire tournament could move
            to Argentina. Eventually, the Argentinian government decided the pandemic was too bad. A national lockdown
            was announced and the moment deemed inappropriate for putting on an international football tournament.<br>
            In stepped Brazil: less than two weeks before the first game, the tournament was moved to the country that
            hosted it in 2019. Relocating the competition from Argentina, which is enduring a terrible time with Covid,
            to a country where more than 460,000 people have died from the disease has sparked huge waves of criticism.
            One Brazilian senator referred to it as the “championship of death”.<br>

            <h2>What they said: The 13 players to play alongside Messi and Ronaldo</h2>
            <hr id="newshr">
        </div>
        <p>The longstanding debate of Cristiano Ronaldo versus Lionel Messi has divided football fans for over a decade
            – but what about the players who know them best?<br>
            The pair are regarded as two of the greatest footballers of all time and they have won 11 of the past 12
            Ballon d’Or awards between them.<br>
            Here’s a selection of quotes from the few players fortunate enough to have played alongside Messi and
            Ronaldo, thanks to help from SPORTbible.<br>
            <b style="letter-spacing: 2px; color: #fe6363;"><u>Gerard Pique</u></b> <br>
            – “Cristiano is a perfect machine, a hard worker who always wants to improve,” Pique told Voetbal Magazine
            in 2014. “He is very demanding of himself, something that he showed at United.<br>
            “Many times conclusions are drawn based on specific actions without actually getting to know him. He has
            changed in recent years, I know him from United and he took to me well. He helped me a lot in
            Manchester.”<br>
            – “I always said that Messi has some talent that no one has,” Pique told BT Sport in 2016. “I mean, he has
            the ball and his speed controlling the ball. The ball doesn’t go two metres far from his foot, it’s always
            there. It’s impossible to catch him, this talent I didn’t see from anyone.<br>
            “But for me it’s like Messi is not human but [Ronaldo] is the best of the humans.”<br>
            <b style="letter-spacing: 2px;color: #fe6363;"><u>Andre Gomes</u></b> <br>
            – “Ronaldo is a very important player, who is always present and ready to play,” Gomes said in 2016. “He is
            very serious about the responsibility of leading our country, we have great spirit, and he’s a great example
            for all of us.”<br>
            – “Everyone knows that Messi is very, very good,” Gomes told L’Esportiu de Catalunya in 2016. “He does
            things in games that you cannot explain; he just knows different things and can do it.<br>
            “In training, it is a show, because every day he can invent something new. You think you’re used to it, but
            there is always one day you go to the dressing room surprised by something he has done.”<br>
            <b style="letter-spacing: 2px;color: #fe6363;"><u>Gonzalo Higuain</u></b> <br>
            – “We had already played together with Real,” Higuain told Fox News on Ronaldo in 2019. “Many years have
            passed, and I have found another player, a more mature person, with a family.<br>

        <p>The 33-year-old is reportedly close to signing a contract extension that will keep him at the Camp Nou until
            the summer of 2023. Lionel Messi has been strongly linked with Manchester City and Paris Saint-Germain after
            he made public his desire to leave Barcelona last summer, but has now seemingly agreed to stay at the
            club.<br>
            Lionel Messi is close to agreeing a two-year contract extension with Barcelona according to reports in
            Spain.<br>
            Spanish newspaper AS report the 33-year-old is on the verge of putting pen to paper on a two-year deal that
            will end intense speculation over his future at the Camp Nou.
            Messi has been strongly linked with Manchester City and Paris Saint-Germain since he publicly expressed his
            desire to leave Barcelona last summer amid concerns over the direction of the club.<br>
            Since then, Josep Bartomeu has been ousted as Barca president, with Joan Laporta returning to the role for a
            second stint earlier this year.<br>
            The report claims only “structural details” are left to be finalised before Messi signs a new contract that
            will keep him at Barcelona until the summer of 2023, when he could decide to play somewhere else.<br>
            A return to Newell’s Old Boys, where Messi was spotted by Barcelona as a youngster, could reportedly be on
            the cards as a “swansong” for the 33-year-old.<br>
            “Things are going well, but it is not a done deal yet,” Laporta said about negotiations with Messi on
            Tuesday.<br>
            “The thing with Leo is that it is not a matter of money from his side. From our side, we know the limits of
            the possibilities we have and he is showing a lot of understanding. He wants to stay and we will try our
            best to make that happen.”<br>
            “The young lads have a great desire,” Messi told the Argentinian national team’s official social media
            channels after joining up with the squad, “the older players too, the same or more. Something really nice
            was generated [during the last qualifiers]. There is a very united group that works together in this era
            that Scaloni has started. We are forming a very good group, and that is the important thing, to create a
            strong group.”<br>
            And so the scene is set for Messi to have another real go at breaking his national team hoodoo. The
            opportunity is coming in circumstances that are far from ideal, but that will surely not diminish his desire
            to finally hit a high note with the sky blue and white shirt.<br>
            End of story? Maybe not or maybe yes. We just have to wait and see for ourselves.<br>
